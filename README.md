## Usage

This project serves as a **static one-page layout** with sections dedicated to various aspects of analytics management. You can easily expand the content or integrate additional features as needed.

- In mobile view, the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu. Clicking the menu reveals a sidebar for easier navigation across different sections.
- Each section of the page (Home, Company, Newsletter, Resources, Contact) has placeholder content that can be replaced with actual data.
